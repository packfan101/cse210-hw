Thank you for taking interest in my recipe manager.

I created this manager to make it easy to track and organize my recipes in one place. I wanted it to be able to provide a recipe at random, which is one of the main menu options.

The List Recipes function lists all recipes in the cookbook without regard of type. If you wish to see recipes of a certain type, use the Search Function and select the "By Type" option.

This recipe program comes with a default cookbook that is loaded automatically every time the program runs. If you wish to switch cookbooks (maybe for mulitiple users) an option is provided for that on the main menu. If you want to start a new cookbook, you can use the change cookbooks function and create a new text file.

All filenames to setup or open a cookbook must be in .txt format. Please add .txt to the filename when entering it.

The program adds recipes in a specific format in the document and must be formatted exactly for the program to recognize the individual parts of the recipe. Please use the "Add Recipe" functionality to add any recipes to your cookbook to ensure formatting stays correct.

For a crockpot/stove recipe: the cook temp should be what you set the crockpot/stove to: (low/medium/high).

For a pressure cooker recipe: you can enter 0 for the temp or leave it blank since there is no way to set the temperature on a pressure cooker. You will be asked for a pressure setting during the recipe creation process.
